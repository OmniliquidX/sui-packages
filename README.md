6. Set optional stop-loss and take-profit levels
7. Execute your trade and monitor via the Positions panel

### 2. üè¶ **OLP Vault - Community Liquidity Pool**

The OLP (Omniliquidity Provider) Vault is inspired by Hyperliquid's HLP model, democratizing access to market-making profits typically reserved for institutional players.

**What is the OLP Vault?**

The OLP Vault is a community-owned liquidity pool that powers Omniliquid's exchange infrastructure. When you deposit into the vault, you're essentially becoming a liquidity provider for the entire protocol, earning returns from:
- Market making activities across all trading pairs
- Liquidation rewards from under-collateralized positions  
- Trading fee revenue sharing
- Protocol-owned trading strategies

**Key Features:**
- **Epoch-Based Withdrawals**: Funds locked for 4 days (1 epoch) to ensure liquidity stability
- **Proportional Rewards**: Earn based on your vault ownership percentage
- **Real-time Performance**: Track APY, TVL, and historical returns
- **Risk Diversification**: Exposure to all protocol activities, not individual trades
- **Transparent Metrics**: Full visibility into vault performance and activities

**Using the OLP Vault:**

*Depositing:*
1. Navigate to the OLP Vault page in the app
2. Review current vault statistics (TVL, APY, recent performance)
3. Connect your wallet if not already connected
4. Enter the amount of SUI you wish to deposit
5. Confirm the transaction to receive OLP tokens representing your vault share
6. Monitor your earnings in real-time through the vault dashboard

*Withdrawing:*
1. Return to the OLP Vault page
2. Click "Withdraw" and enter the amount of OLP tokens to redeem
3. If the 4-day lockup period has passed, confirm to receive your SUI plus earnings
4. If still within lockup, the interface shows your unlock countdown

**Vault Performance Metrics:**
- **Total Value Locked (TVL)**: Current size of the liquidity pool
- **All-Time Return**: Cumulative performance since vault inception  
- **30-Day APY**: Annualized returns based on recent 30-day performance
- **Your Performance**: Personal P&L and percentage returns
- **Trading Activity**: Recent protocol trades and market-making activities

### 3. üîí **OMN Token Staking**

Stake OMN tokens to earn rewards and participate in protocol governance with flexible lock periods and reward multipliers.

**Staking Features:**
- **Flexible Lock Periods**: No lock to 3 months with increasing reward multipliers
- **Reward Multipliers**: Up to 1.2x rewards for longer lock commitments
- **Governance Rights**: Vote on protocol parameters and upgrades
- **Trading Fee Discounts**: Up to 30% reduction in trading fees
- **Compound Rewards**: Automatically reinvest earnings

**Lock Period Options:**
- **No Lock**: 1.0x multipl# Omniliquid Move Modules - Fixed Version

## üìã Prerequisites

- [Sui CLI](https://docs.sui.io/build/install) v1.15.0 or later
- Sui wallet configured
- Sufficient SUI for gas fees (recommend 1+ SUI for deployment)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Deployment

1. **Clone and build the project:**
```bash
git clone <your-repo>
cd omniliquid
sui move build
```

2. **Deploy to testnet:**
```bash
chmod +x scripts/deploy.sh
./scripts/deploy.sh testnet
```

3. **Deploy to mainnet:**
```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh mainnet
```

## üîß Post-Deployment Configuration

After deployment, you'll need to:

1. **Fund the Treasury**: The protocol treasury needs initial liquidity
```bash
# Use the treasury admin cap to fund with SUI
sui client call \
    --package $PACKAGE_ID \
    --module treasury \
    --function fund_treasury \
    --args $TREASURY_ID $ADMIN_CAP_ID $FUNDING_COIN_ID \
    --gas-budget 10000000
```

2. **Update Price Feeds**: Set initial prices for markets
```bash
# Update BTC price
sui client call \
    --package $PACKAGE_ID \
    --module price_oracle \
    --function update_price \
    --args $ORACLE_ID $ORACLE_ADMIN_CAP '"BTC"' 50000000000000 100 $CLOCK_ID \
    --gas-budget 10000000
```

## üíº Usage Examples

### Opening a Trading Position (Updated)

```move
// Open a long BTC position with treasury integration
let position = trading::open_position(
    &mut market_state,
    &price_oracle,
    &mut treasury,        // Treasury required
    string::utf8(b"BTC"),
    collateral_coin,      // 1 SUI collateral
    100000000,           // 0.1 BTC size
    true,                // long position
    5,                   // 5x leverage
    &clock,
    ctx
);
```

### Depositing Collateral (Updated)

```move
// Create collateral with proper balance handling
let collateral = collateral::create_and_deposit(
    deposit_coin,        // SUI coin
    &clock,
    ctx
);
```

## üîí Security Improvements

- **Treasury System**: All funds managed through secure treasury
- **Balance Handling**: Proper SUI balance management
- **Access Control**: Updated admin capabilities
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error codes as functions
- **Type Safety**: Fixed all type constraints and abilities

## üß™ Testing

The modules include comprehensive tests. Run them with:

```bash
sui move test
```

**Note**: Some tests may need updates to work with the new treasury system. Update test scenarios to include treasury initialization.

## üîß Integration Updates for Frontend

Your existing hooks should work with minimal changes, but note:

1. **Treasury Integration**: Trading functions now require treasury parameter
2. **Balance Handling**: Collateral now uses Balance<SUI> internally
3. **Constants Access**: All constants are now function calls
4. **Error Codes**: Error codes are now returned by functions

### Example Hook Update

```typescript
// Before
const requiredCollateral = SIZE * PRICE / LEVERAGE;

// After  
const requiredCollateral = calculateRequiredCollateral(size, price, leverage);
```

## üêõ Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Invalid module access" for constants
**Solution**: All constants are now functions. Use `constants::price_precision()` instead of `constants::PRICE_PRECISION`.

### Issue: "Restricted visibility" for Position struct
**Solution**: Use `position::destroy_position()` function instead of direct struct destruction.

### Issue: Coin minting errors
**Solution**: All coin operations now go through the treasury system.

## üìà Performance Considerations

- **Order Book**: Simplified matching for better gas efficiency
- **Treasury**: Centralized fund management reduces complexity
- **Constants**: Function-based constants may have slight gas overhead
